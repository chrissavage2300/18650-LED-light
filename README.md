# 18650-LED-light
This is a high powered LED light powered by a 18650 Battery. 

* Uses Cree J Series Neutral white 3030 LED's.
* LED's Run at 150mA for double the amount of flux. They are connected in a 2P3S format. You can chose to solder one side or the other
* Features mounting holes for transparent 3D printed cover to scatter the light and protect the LED's
* Has Space for 2 18650 Lithium Batteries. I plan on reusing ones Ive salvaged which amount to around 1500mAh to 2000mAh.
* Run time at lowest setting (62mA for 1 string) should be 24 Hours using a 1500mAh Battery. This needs to be tested.
* 10 Hours at the brightest setting. 
* Has a built in USB charger with status LED's. Charge current is 500mA.
